      "<p>I worked for World First as a contract Front-end Engineer for the first 6 months. After becoming permanent as a Senior Software Engineer, I was finally promoted to Front-end Team Lead. I initially worked on the trading platform, integrating Xero accountancy software. Following this, I joined the statements team, where I implemented new UI features and components, improved the platform's micro front-end codebases by moving from React Classes to React Hooks, increased test coverage, and enhanced general code quality.</p><p>After being promoted to Front-end Team Lead, I was responsible for managing the team's goals, deliverables, and conducting individuals’ performance reviews. During my time as Front-end Lead, my team and I were heavily involved in helping deliver a new multi-region front-end for the trading platform. We used react-i18next for translations and developed region-specific logic to cater for varying rules, regulations, and rates. On a day-to-day basis, we worked closely with back-end teams, Product, UX, and Design across the UK and APAC to ensure everything ran as smoothly as possible.</p>",

      "<p>Whilst with GE I worked on a SPA (Single Page Application) building a tool to help the telecoms industry to locate, route and cost new fibre connections. We used Web Components with Polymer to build UI Components, SASS for the CSS, and Node.js with Express for the back-end. We used Mocha and Chai to write our tests on the front-end and Gulp for the build step.</p><p>I also introduced the team at GE to the use of React and Redux with Jest and Enzyme for testing. Using React I built a SPA tool to demonstrate the use of API’s developed for the telecoms routing application. This project was also used as a way for the team to learn React, Redux, Jest and Webpack. I held several one-to-one sessions with other developers explaining how to structure a React and Redux application and demonstrate component development and best practices. We worked in an agile manner with fortnightly sprint cycles.</p>",

      "<p>Whilst I was with Cash Flows I worked on a Visa prepaid-wallet. We built the front-end in React with SASS for our CSS and Webpack to manage the front-end build. When I started with Cash Flows some early development had already taken place on the product but the application wasn’t fully responsive and had limited browser and device support. I introduced a mobile first responsive approach to the application, as well as cross-browser and device support. I also introduced a test framework using Jest and Enzyme, added linting for the SASS and JavaScript, refactored and optimised the code and introduced new features. We worked in an agile manner with three-week sprint cycles, sizing sessions, breakdown sessions and retrospectives.</p>",

      "<p>In my role with Boiler Juice I managed a team of four Developers. I was responsible for choosing technologies and implementing best practices across the front-end of the website. I was actively coding on a day-to-day basis implementing features, debugging and pairing with other developers. I was also responsible for supporting more junior team members. My time was divided between coding (70%) as well as meetings and team management tasks (30%).</p><p>We were tasked with re-building the front-end of the existing website. In places we replicated the existing look and feel and in others we introduced a new style and set of HTML templates and reusable components. We completely re-wrote the JavaScript untangling many years of un-documented business logic and functionality.</p><p>We built a custom JavaScript framework to manage our JavaScript modules and used a mobile first approach to the build of Responsive HTML page templates, utilising the bootstrap-sass framework for our grid. We used Browserify and Gulp to manage our JavaScript modules and ran linting against all JavaScript and SASS files to maintain code quality.</p><p>On a day-to-day basis we worked closely with the UX Team and the wider business to make sure all requirements were met. We also worked closely with the back-end team integrating the front-end with a PHP based CMS called Bolt, which utilises twig templates for page template structure. We worked in an agile manner with daily stand-ups; working in fortnightly sprints.</p>",
